This repository contains autonomous bot related codes

1. Track Hunter - It is autonomous bot using 8 array ir sensor , L298N motor drive powered with a buck and simple 200rpm dc powered with 11.1 rechargable battery 
Main Objective - To traverse through the track and blink led at cheack points 

2. Track Hunter using PID - It is also a track hunter bot with same specification but instead of using manual ,if else loop it uses Proportional ,derivative and integral control for the smooth transition of the bot.

3. Block city - main objective to use a autonomous bot to traverse through the track and give a indication on blocks using UV sensor 

4. Maze Follower - It is a miniature bot which is able to traverse through a inversion track but traversing it once and storing the value in the array.
   
6. Motor Check - It is a code to check the polarity of motor while using the motor driver
